<h2>Rodothea Myrsini (Romy) Tsoupidi</h2>
<p>
My name is Romy and, I currently work as an software engineer at 
<a href=https://sambanova.ai/>SambaNova</a>.
In June 2023, I  defended my Ph.D. at the School of <a href=https://www.kth.se/en/eecs/skolan-for-elektroteknik-och-datavetenskap-1.760855> Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)</a>,
Royal Institute of Technology (KTH).
My main research interests are in the area of compiler design, software-based security, 
side-channel attack mitigations,
constraint programming, software diversification, and SMT solving.
