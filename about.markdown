My name is Romy and, currently,
I am a PhD student at the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)](https://www.kth.se/en/eecs/skolan-for-elektroteknik-och-datavetenskap-1.760855),
Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), 
under the supervision of [Benoit Baudry](https://www.kth.se/profile/baudry) and [Musard Balliu](https://people.kth.se/~musard/). 
My main research interests are in the area of software-based security, 
software diversification, constraint programming and SMT solving.
