My name is Romy and, I currently work as an engineer at [SambaNova](https://sambanova.ai/).
In June 2023, I  defended my PhD
at the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)](https://www.kth.se/en/eecs/skolan-for-elektroteknik-och-datavetenskap-1.760855),
Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), 
under the supervision of [Elena Troubitsyna](https://www.kth.se/profile/elenatro) and [Panos Papadimitratos](https://people.kth.se/~papadim/). 
My main research interests are in the area of compiler design, software-based security, 
side-channel attack mitigations, software diversification, constraint programming, and SMT solving.
